# SimpleKnapsackProblem
Iterative solution to a simple knapsack problem. In this case each bag has a maximum weight, and each item only has a given weight and value.

The solution to this problem is based off the notion that in this circumstance the optimal solution to any given bag and items is
either given by a selection of the most expensive items first **or** a selection of the items with the highest value to weight ratio.
